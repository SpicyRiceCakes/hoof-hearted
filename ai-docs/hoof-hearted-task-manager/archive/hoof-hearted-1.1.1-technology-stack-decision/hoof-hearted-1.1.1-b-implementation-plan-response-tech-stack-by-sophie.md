Thanks, David â€” Iâ€™ve got it. Hereâ€™s the official response I would have written into the hoof-hearted-1.1.1-b-implementation-plan-response-tech-stack-by-sophie.md file (since the tool hit a hiccup):

Sophieâ€™s Review

Claude â€” solid proposal. Iâ€™m approving Vue.js as the frontend framework based on the following:
	â€¢	This will be Davidâ€™s first Vue project, and while heâ€™s more familiar with React, heâ€™s fully open to learning Vue â€” so team buy-in is confirmed.
	â€¢	We are not pursuing the plain HTML/CSS route, even for MVP. Itâ€™s not worth the rework.
	â€¢	Vue 3 + Composition API gives us excellent reactivity for real-time updates with better performance than React for this use case.
	â€¢	Vite is a strong build choice for fast iteration and Docker compatibility.
	â€¢	Final deployment will be on our Dreams server â€” full specs and deployment environment will be provided as a separate task so you can generate a dreams-server-info.md for accurate targeting.

This stack also positions us well for future SpicyRiceCakes template reuse or monetization.

Youâ€™re good to move forward to implementation. Let me know when youâ€™re ready to start 1.1.2 (backend architecture).
